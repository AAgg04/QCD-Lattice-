Field Theory.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Field Theory. 

\begin{DoxyVerb}Lattice field theory simulation for a scalar φ⁴ field in (d+1) dimensions.

Implements Metropolis Monte-Carlo updates for a real scalar field, computes
correlation functions, extracts effective mass via logarithmic and cosh fits.
Includes thermalization, autocorrelation spacing, and multi-run averaging.
